ModHeader Legacy is a browser extension that allow you to modify HTTP request and response headers. It is a fork of the **legacy 2.5.4** version of the [original ModHeader extension](https://github.com/bewisse/modheader) which transitioned to 3.0.0 in April 2020.

**Credit:** All credit for this extension goes to the original author, [Hao Nguyen](https://github.com/hao1300).  Everything below this line is from the original version and all other parts of this extension remain exactly the same except for the name.
